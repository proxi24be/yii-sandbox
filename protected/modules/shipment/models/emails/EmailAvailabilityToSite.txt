Dear Sir or Madam,

Please find attached the list of biological sample(s) that we would like to ship to the central repository.
Please forward this message to the relevant person(s) within your team.

It is necessary that you confirm in the Biotracking system if this/these sample(s) can or cannot be sent.

Please first log into the BrEAST website (https://www.br-e-a-s-t.org) using your user ID and password.  
Then click on the BIOTRACKING link and choose the 'Request for shipment' menu item in the menu bar.

If the sample(s) can be sent, please confirm by checking the provided tick box in the confirm availability field.

If you are not able to send a sample for any reason (e.g. sample is lost, or accidentally destroyed), 
please update the 'sample status', do not tick the box 'Confirm availability' and report a comment in the 'Reason for change' field.

Please consult the user's manual for further details. The manual can be downloaded from the menu bar in the Biotracking system.

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at breast.translational@bordet.be

Kind regards,
BrEAST Translational Research Coordinator on behalf of BIG
