<h3 class="faq">Frequently asked questions (F.A.Q.)</h3>

<p class="faq"><b>Where can I find the Manual for the use of Biotracking?</b><br />The most recent version of the Investigator’s manual can be accessed and downloaded from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.</p>

<p class="faq"><b>How long will I have to wait for the central lab HER2 and hormonal receptor results?</b><br />Central results will be available for most of the cases not longer than 5 working days from reception at the central laboratory.<br /><br />
In cases with discordant results the timeline could go up to 7 working days (10-15% of all cases) when needed to double-check and repeat the assay, if necessary. 
Indeed, when running a central review, the central lab have to deal with tissues fixed in a very diverse manner, and to avoid false negative results sometimes it is needed to modify the analytical conditions to try and get a confirmatory evidence of the local data. This ensures that eligible patients are not denied enrollment in the trial because of pre-analytical oddities. As an example, if a case result HER2 negative centrally while it was locally considered 3+ by IHC and FISH amplified, they are reluctant to call it negative without having repeated the assays with different schedules of tissue pre-treatment, to accommodate different fixation procedures. The same holds true for ER and PgR status.</p>

<p class="faq"><b>How will I be informed of the central lab HER2 and hormonal receptors results?</b><br />The Central Lab results will be sent to the Principal Investigator by email. Results will also be available on the Biotracking (see Investigator’s manual).</p>

<p class="faq"><b>Shall I perform the sample tracking steps (sample tracking and sample shipment) at the same time?</b><br />Each step can be performed at different times.</a></p>

<p class="faq"><b>Who can I contact in case of technical problems?</b><br />Any technical issue should be forwarded to <a style="color:blue" href="mailto:breast.technical@bordet.be">breast.technical@bordet.be</a></p>

<p class="faq"><b>When should I expect to have the FFPE tumour blocks returned from central lab?</b><br />The tumour blocks will be returned within 12 weeks from reception at the central lab</a></p>

<p class="faq"><b>My user’s account is blocked, what shall I do?</b><br />Contact <a style="color:blue" href="mailto:breast.technical@bordet.be">breast.technical@bordet.be</a></p>

<p class="faq"><b>My password is expired (or I forgot my password), what shall I do?</b><br />Click on the link “Reset my password” and follow the instructions.</p>

<p class="faq"><b>I realised that I made a mistake in tracking a sample, what shall I do?</b><br />Complete an error reporting web form, accessible from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.</p>
<p class="faq"><b>What are the requirements for Biotracking?</b><br />You can access to Biotracking via a PC, Linux, Macintosh(Mac) computer as long as a modern web browser is installed on your computer, javascript must be also activated(or active).</p>
<p class="faq"><b>What browsers are supported by Biotracking?</b><br/>We recommend using these to get all Biotracking features:</p>
<ul class="faq">
    <li>Google Chrome 12 or above (download <a style="color:blue" href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Windows</a>)</li>
    <li>Mozilla Firefox 4 or above (download <a style="color:blue" href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/">Windows</a>)</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer 7.0 or above</li>
    <li>Safari 4.0 or above (download <a style="color:blue" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Windows</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="faq"><b>How do I know if my web browser is compatible?</b><br/>Biotracking system detects automatically which web browser you are using therefore if an update is required, 
    a pop-up windows will appear to invite you to perform that step.</p>
<p class="faq"><b>Why should I update my web browser?</b><br/>Older browsers are more vulnerable to attacks than newer browsers. When Microsoft, Google, Mozilla or Apple find out about a security issue they fix it and make an updated browser available. In addition newer browsers use newer technology which means you get often a better browsing experience in terms of speed/performance 
    as well as compatibility. Newer browsers are free so you can install/remove them at your will.</p>
<p class="faq"><b>I do not see my PDF form, what shall I do?</b><br/>You have to check , if you have one, the setting of your pop-up blocker. If it is turned on you will need to configure it and to allow pop-up windows from Biotracking website.</p>
<p class="faq"><b>What is a pop-up?</b><br/>A pop-up is a small web browser window that appears on top of the website you're viewing.</p>
<p class="faq"><b>What is a pop-up blocker?</b><br/>Pop-up Blocker is a feature integrate in modern web browser that lets you limit or block most pop-ups. You can choose the level of blocking you prefer, from blocking all pop-up windows to allowing the pop-ups that you want to see. When Pop-up Blocker is turned on, and a pop-up windows is blocked you will see usually a notification message. The notification message displayed depends on which browser you are using.</p>
<p class="faq"><b>Does Biotracking sytem uses pop-up?</b><br/>Yes that is why if your pop-up blocker is turned on you must configure it to accept pop-up from biotracking. Biotracking pop-ups are safe and do not contain any ad.</p>
